# ValueChain-FlowChart-Simulator
For now, a template for parallel processing with random number generator properly initialized for each process. One can build any Monte Carlo simulation or integration program based on this template.

[Work In Progress] A Monte-Carlo simulation platform for arbitrary user-defined flowchart, item placement and more!

[ToDo] Allow Steps to have arbitrary "depth".

[ToDo] Allow Items to have arbitrary "depth".

[ToDo] Implement schedule and conflict management scheme.

[ToDo] Improve the inout interface of the user-defined flowchart from a .csv file to an API that is friendly toward ML.
